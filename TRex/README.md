## 📝 <span id="description">Description</span>

### Project Overview:
This project aims to recreate the gameplay of Google Chrome's Dino T-Rex game using Unity, focusing on fundamental game development concepts such as player control, collision management, and dynamic procedural level generation. Leveraging insights from various video tutorials and incorporating royalty-free asset packs, I have added my personal touch to the code, introducing enhanced functionalities

### Objective and scope:
The primary goal is educational, serving as an exercise to grasp essential game development principles. The secondary objective involves mastering Git and GitHub within the Unity environment, laying the groundwork for future, more complex projects. This experience has been valuable for honing version control skills, ensuring a robust foundation for efficient collaboration and project management in subsequent endeavors.

### Non-Profit and learning emphasis:
It's important to note that this project is entirely non-profit and undertaken purely as a learning exercise. The code is intentionally over-commented to aid understanding, reflecting my commitment to detailed explanations for educational purposes. While functional, the code requires further improvement and optimization, presenting an excellent opportunity for ongoing learning and refinement.
